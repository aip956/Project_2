-My trello board laid out the steps to create the CRUD-functionality, plus icebox items for styling.
-It also includes some wireframes and a simple ERD (entity relationship diagram)

2. DEMONSTRATE THE PROJECT

Login as non-user and see Relogin.ejs
Login as new user and logout
Login as cheese, gouda

Index page lists the items, and I had fun with the overlapping cards and popout
Hover on link pops link; this was inspired/copied!
In show page, I can edit and delete
Edit a card
Delete a card
Create a card
Chocolate schema: models/choc.js
Favorite ejs template is the index page
Controller for main model is controllers/choc.js
Biggest challenge: "Lots of little things"; incorrect links, CSS and sometimes the styling doesn't apply
Takeaway: I'm glad we got lots of crud practice in, and while the Pokedex was really hard, I applied some of the styling here

I didn't have time, but in the future would:
-Make the new and edit pages more like the show page
-Add search functionality
